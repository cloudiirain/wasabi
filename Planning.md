* View Series Detail
* View Series List
* View Chapter Detail
* View Chapter List
* Register as a User
* Login as a User (or attempt to)

### Contributor ###

* Add a new Chapter
* Edit a Chapter that is shared with them
* Edit a Chapter that belongs to them
* Share a Chapter that belongs to them with other users
* Delete a Chapter that belongs to them
